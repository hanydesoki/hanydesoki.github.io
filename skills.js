            Python is my go to langage for almost every project I do. 
            During my experiences, I learned every aspect of the language
            by working on all kind of project:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Data Analysis / Data Science with numpy / pandas, pyspark and other</li>
            <li>Machine Learning with Scikit Lean / Tensorflow</li>
            <li>Web scrapping</li>
            <li>Rest API</li>
            <li>Games</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            With my experience, I'm able to understand very well how Python work
            on a lower level:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Decorators</li>
            <li>Dunder methods</li>
            <li>Generators</li>
            <li>Metaclasses</li>
            <li>Descriptors</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            By knowing all of this aspect, It is easy for me to quickly learn 
            new frameworks since most of them are built the same way.
        </p>

            During my experience as application engineer, I builted a lot of web app
            especially dashboards to display KPIs for client.
        </p>
        <p>
            I used it for DOM manipulation (interactivity) but also a lot for
            data manipulations to format query results and display them.
        </p>
        <p>
            I organise my code to make very modular applications so that we can do significative
            changes by tweeking some parameters which make appplication easy and fast to develop.
        </p>
        <p>
            A recent exemple is building entire page only by feeding a json object that contains
            parameters.

            An application can go from bad to amazing with just good css and nothing more!
        </p>
        <p>
            Some dashboard that I builded as application engineer were done on
            a low code based platform where we don't have DOM access. So I relied 
            a lot with css to achieve similar results.
